# Getting started with TON smart contracts
Develop for TON in Solidity 
Develop for TON in C++ 

We provide a set of compilers and tools to assist with the full smart contract development cycle in Free TON: 
* Write source code: check out contract examples for high level languages of choice - Solidity, C++ or C
* Compile source to assembly: invoke optimizing compilers generating native code for TON VM (TVM) 
* Translate assembly text to binary: assemble and link contract code with standard or custom libraries 
* Secure blockchain interaction: generate or use an existing key pair to communicate with the contract in the blockchain 
* Define account address: compute a unique address for the contract based on its code, initial data and keys 
* Create an account: prepare an account for contract deployment by sending a message transferring blockchain currency to the account address 
* Secure contract deployment: encode the contract binary and sign it with the key pair 
* Initialize the account: send the prepared constructor message to the contract address 
* Work with the contract: use the contract as intended by sending messages to the account address in the blockchain
